JArchive Web Scraper

My first time making a web scraper. 

test.py loads a single page and prints it

testMySql.py loads a row from my mySql db

practice.py asks for a game id, gets the game, and saves it to a csv file

organized.py finds the latest game from the db and starts scraping the games after that
